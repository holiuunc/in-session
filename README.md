# In-Session

In Session is a macOS application designed to help you stay focused on your tasks by intelligently monitoring your on-screen activity. Using the power of AI, it gently nudges you back to work whenever it detects that you've strayed from your intended goal.

## What is this?

In a world full of digital distractions, maintaining focus is harder than ever. In-Session acts as your personal focus-keeper. You simply tell the app what you're working on, and it periodically analyzes your screen to determine if your current activity aligns with that task. If you're on track, it stays silent. If you get distracted, it sends a notification to remind you of your goal.

## How It Works

1.  **Set Your Goal:** At the start of a work session, you provide a simple written description of your task (e.g., "writing a report on Q3 sales figures" or "coding the user authentication feature").
2.  **Start Session:** With a single click, you begin your focus session.
3.  **AI Analysis:** Every 15 seconds, the app takes a screenshot of your screen. This screenshot, along with your stated goal, is sent to a cloud-based AI to analyze the content.
4.  **Stay on Task:** The AI determines if the applications, websites, and content on your screen are relevant to your task.
5.  **Get a Nudge:** If the AI concludes you're off-task, a standard macOS notification will pop up to gently guide you back to your work.
